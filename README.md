#Marketing
1.  Most apps that succeed do so because of advertising and product awareness. No one will download your app if they dont know its there.
2.  Contact popular app reviewers, bloggers, you tubers, twitter, facebook, instagram, snapchat, etc...  
3.  Reviews are very important, they are version based and directly affect app success.  
4.  Constant communication with the userbase is key.  
5.  App name, icon, description, screenshots and developer activity all account for success.  
6.  Review stars and overall number of reviews can sway customer opinion  
7.  Review farming must be handled lightly, dont nag, request a review as politely as possible.  
      * Maybe just a link to review in the "settings" area, a subtle hint to rate the app, stay away from popups that interupt the user expereince. 
      * The overcast philosophy on ratings is a perfect example of this. Display how many people have rated a particular version somewhere in the app with a link to review it yourself. ("X amount of people have rated this version of "APPNAME") We will never interrupt you for review requests.  
8.  BANNER ADS ARE ANNOYING, stray away, find another model.  
9.  PAY WALLS SUCK. Dont do it.  
10. Utilize app alalytics. Pay attention to fine details and always respond to reviews.  
     * App analytics are very important for very detailed reporting.  
     * Always research the market and similar apps. Read their reviews and find areas for capitalization.

A good place to test code while away from a mac is IBM bluemix. A web based playground running the latest version of Swift.
