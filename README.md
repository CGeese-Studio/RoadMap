# RoadMap
Roadmap for app development  
---  
### A centralized place to keep ideas, recommendations, progress and milestones.  
Most apps that succeed do so because of advertising and product awareness. No one will download your app if they dont know its there.  
Contact popular app reviewers, bloggers, you tubers, twitter, facebook, instagram, snapchat, etc...  
Reviews are very important, they are version based and directly affect app success.  
Constant communication with the userbase is key.  
App name, description, screenshots and developer activity all account for success.
