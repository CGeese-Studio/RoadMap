Chris,

What you have put together is very impressive. I have tried
to incorporate things like you are suggesting in the past but it was not
received well and the feedback that I got was that it overcomplicated things.
Leadership still wanted MyMetrics and CWP to be the go-to areas for MTD
performance and commissions so the focus of the VSB stayed with daily results.
It also became increasing more frustrating for me when there would be a change
to the commission structure and it would require a rework of the tool. On that
note, the DMs and leadership asked me to simplify the VSB so I had to cut down
on the things we had available to track. You may have noticed these changes but
they are very particular about what the rep experience is and often times
decide that less is more.

I am completely self-taught with Google Sheets but I have zero
experience with app building. As far as CPNI, the type of data you would need
access to in order to have the functionality you discuss below I think would be
hard to get from Sprint as you would need to pull from lots of data sources
that aren’t easily accessible. Additionally, with your call back program, the
numbers would need to be scrubbed against our DNC tool each and every time a
call was made so those controls would need to be put in place too. Another
thing to think about is what happens to that app and its data when an employee
leaves the company? And, since the app would be on their personal device, we
would need to pay the employee each time they used it and that could cause OT
issues and cost the company money. If you have specific questions regarding
CPNI, I suggest emailing officeofprivacy@sprint.com
; they may be able to help confirm what you can and cannot do with your app.

Lastly, I want to apologize for the delay in responding to
you. This message got buried in my email and I just didn’t have the time to
thoughtfully respond.

Thanks,

Subject: ideas

I’d like to bounce a few ideas off of you and gather as much
input as I can. 

I’m rather well versed in google sheets and automated
scripting, I have built a compensation estimator that imports data from VSB and
compiles commissions payouts in real time. Over the last 6 months I have been
+/- 1% accuracy in tracking my own commissions. With your experience building
all these web apps and trackers  I’d love to show it to you and see what
you think. 

I know that the STARs compensation estimator is available, if
you understand how to use it and what everything means. That’s helpful but not
very straight forward, never mentioned and I assume, hardly ever used. Not to
mention, if you don’t save it to your personal drive, if you have one. There’s
no real way to keep it fully updated in real time. It’s a spur of the moment
estimator at best. 

What I would like to do is take the next step and
incorporate what I have built into an iOS application (android to follow) and
possibly make it available to those it would help. 

That’s where your experience would come in handy, I need to
know what I can and can’t do as it pertains to CPNI. I envision an app that
allows you to not only input sales information and estimate comp. but customer
contact details as well, then on timed intervals notifies the rep for follow up
contact. An all in one sales pipeline built into an app. It would combine VSB,
the compensation estimator, call logger and a detailed report of all sales
performed by the user.
